= Layer 2 and layer 3 topologies

A layer 2 topology creates a virtual switch that is distributed across all nodes in a cluster. Virtual machines and pods connect to this virtual switch so that all these components can communicate with each other within the same subnet. If you decide not to specify a layer 2 subnet, then you must manually configure IP addresses for each pod in your cluster. When you do not specify a layer 2 subnet, port security is limited to preventing Media Access Control (MAC) spoofing only, and does not include IP spoofing. A layer 2 topology creates a single broadcast domain that can be challenging in large network environments, where the topology might cause a broadcast storm that can degrade network performance. 

The following diagram shows two nodes that use an UDN with a layer 2 topology to live migrate a pod from `Node 1` to `Node 2`. Each node includes two interfaces:

* A node interface, which is a compute node that connects networking components to the node.
* An Open vSwitch (OVS) bridge such as `br-ex`, which creates an layer 2 OVN switch so that pods can communicate with each other and share resources. 

An external switch connects these two interfaces, while the gateway or router handles routing traffic between the external switch and the layer 2 OVN switch. Pods in a node can use the UDN to communicate with each other. The layer 2 OVN switch handles node traffic over UDN so that live migrate of a pod from one node to another is possible.

A layer 3 topology creates a unique layer 2 segment for each node in a cluster. The layer 3 routing mechanism interconnects these segments so that virtual machines and pods that are hosted on different nodes can communicate with each other. A layer 3 topology can effectively manage large broadcast domains by assigning each domain to a specific node, so that broadcast traffic has a reduced scope. To configure a layer 3 topology, you must configure `cidr` and `hostSubnet` parameters.
